                <b>Bangunan Sultan Iskandar</b> & <b>Gelang Patah</b> which are situated in <b>Johor</b> are leading as the top entry location.
                This shows that Johor experiences the highest traffic due to its <b>strategic location</b>
                at the <b>Malaysia-Singapore border</b>. Every day, thousands of Malaysians and Singaporeans
                cross between the two countries for work, leisure, and trade, making it one of the

                seperated by gender. It clearly shows the <b>significant decline</b> in arrivals at the

            <p>However, starting from <b>early 2022</b>, we see a gradual recovery as Malaysia reopens

                By <b>late 2023</b>, arrivals reach a <b>stable point</b>, reflecting the <b>normalization of

                    This suggests a slight <b>male dominance</b> in foreign travel to Malaysia.

                    especially in regions like Johor where daily crossings are common. The gender

            <p>The <b>bar chart</b> above shows the number of foreign arrivals into Malaysia, broken down by <b>state</b>. 
                Johor stands out with the <b>highest number</b> of arrivals, far surpassing other states. 
                Meanwhile, <b>Selangor</b>, which includes <b>Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA)</b>, ranks second in terms 
                of foreign arrivals. As the main <b>international gateway</b> for air travelers into Malaysia, it is 
                a major <b>entry point</b> for <b>tourists</b>, <b>business travelers</b>, and <b>international connections</b>.
            </p>

            <p>In contrast, states like <b>Terengganu</b>, <b>Pahang</b>, and <b>Melaka</b> exhibit significantly lower arrival numbers 
                due to their smaller <b>international entry points</b>, <b>limited air traffic</b>, and <b>geographical factors</b>. 
                These states tend to attract more <b>domestic</b> than international tourists, resulting in fewer foreign 
                arrivals compared to Johor and Selangor. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The disparity in arrival numbers highlights the impact of accessibility and <b>regional connectivity</b> 
                on tourism patterns within Malaysia, illustrating how certain states benefit from their strategic 
                locations while others face challenges in attracting international visitors.
